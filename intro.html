                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
		    I was born in Huanggang, Hubei, a small town in central China. The greatest river of China, Yangtze River, run directly before my frontyard, where I can fish all day in my childhood. I attended undergraduate in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and obtained my Bachelor of Science in chemical physics.

		    <br>		
		    After that, I moved to Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for my PhD in experimental electrocatalysis. Things weren't going well there, as quoted from my mentors, "tried to synthesis a wire but got a cube, tried to synthesis a cube but got a whatever chunk it is"
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    I then decided to quit my PhD in experimental chemistry and instead pursued a PhD in theoretical chemistry under Prof. David Yarkony in Johns Hopkins. At there I finally found myself a little bit more useful than I was. After obtaining my PhD in 2022, I am now a postdoctoral associate in University of Chicago in Prof. David Mazziotti's group.

		            I have a cat named KitKat. I watch anime. I don't code in Fortran unless I have to.
