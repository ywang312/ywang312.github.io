                <h2>My life in China</h2>
                <p>
		    I was born in Huanggang, Hubei Province, a small town in central China. 
		    <br>
		    The most famous (and my favorite) food is hot dry noodles（热干面）. 
		    <br>
		    The world's third longest and the greatest river of China, Yangtze River, run directly before my frontyard, where I can fish all day in my childhood. 
		    <br>
		    From 2012 to 2016, I attended undergraduate at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in the nearby province Anhui.
		    <br>	
		    I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Chemical Physics, a interdisciplinary degree where I studied both physics and chemistry.

		<h2>My life in US</h2>
		<p>
		    In 2016, I joined Johns Hopkins University for my PhD in chemical engineering.
                    <br>
                    I worked in a group with experimental electrocatalysis. Things didn't go well there. I was known for <i> not </i> synthesizing what I need. Also I was known as the "TEM&SEM killer".
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    I then decided to quit my PhD in experimental chemistry and instead pursued a PhD in theoretical chemistry under Prof. David Yarkony in Johns Hopkins. At there I finally found myself a little bit more useful than I was. After obtaining my PhD in 2022, I am now a postdoctoral associate in University of Chicago in Prof. David Mazziotti's group.

                <h2>Some more random facts about me</h2>
                <p>
		            I have a cat named KitKat. I watch anime. I don't code in Fortran unless I have to.
